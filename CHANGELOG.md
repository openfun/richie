  the first organization by node path.
- Fix an issue in Course Search that removed existing filters in some cases
  when using full text search.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-02-06

### Added

## [1.0.0-beta.0] - 2019-02-04

This release indicates our intention to release richie 1.0. It also marks the
beginning of this changelog.

Here are the core features that enabled us to reach this milestone:

- index the courses, organizations & subjects (now categories) in ElasticSearch
  from the DjangoCMS models;
- create course snapshots to keep a history of the versions of a course Page
  throughout its various course runs;
- add full text search queries to the course Search;
- handle facet counts for all our filters in course Search;
- develop plugins for all essential parts: courses, organizations, categories,
  people, licences...

As we prepare to release, here are some improvements and fixes still ahead of
us:

- allow nesting of categories, to let users customize "meta" categories and
  build their own subtrees;
- finish integrating the missing pages and improve the sandbox environment;
- test and polish the use of richie as a django app / node dependency.
