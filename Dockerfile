# Richie A FUN CMS for Open edX

# Nota bene:
#
# this container expects two volumes for statics and media files (that will be
# served by nginx):
#
# * /data/media
# * /data/static
#
# Once mounted, you will need to collect static files via the eponym django
# admin command:
#
#     python sandbox/manage.py collectstatic
