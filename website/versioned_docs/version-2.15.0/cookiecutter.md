We use [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) to help you
set up a production-ready learning portal website based on
[Richie](https://github.com/openfun/richie) in seconds.

## Run Cookiecutter

There are 2 options to run Cookiecutter:
- [install it on your machine][1]
- run it with Docker

While you think of it, navigate to the directory in which you want to create
your site factory:

```
cd /path/to/your/code/directory
```

If you chose to install Cookiecutter, you can now run it against our
[template][2] as follows:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:openfun/richie --directory cookiecutter
```

If you didn't want to install it on your machine, we provide a Docker image
built with our [own repository][4] that you can use as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $PWD:/app \
fundocker/cookiecutter gh:openfun/richie --directory cookiecutter
```

The `--directory` option is to indicate that our Cookiecutter template is in
a `cookiecutter` directory inside our git repository and not at the root.

You will be prompted to enter an organization name, which will determine the
name of your repository. For example, if you choose "foo" as organization
name, your repository will be named `foo-richie-site-factory`. It's
nice if you keep it that way so all richie site factories follow this
convention.

When you confirm the organization name, Cookiecutter will generate your
project from the Cookiecutter template and place it at the level where you
currently are.

### Bootstrap your project

Enter the newly created project and add a new site to your site factory:

```bash
cd foo-richie-site-factory
make add-site
```

This script also uses Cookiecutter against our [site template][3].

Once your new site is created, activate it:

```bash
bin/activate
```

Now bootstrap the site to build its docker image, create its media folder,
database, etc.:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

Once the bootstrap phase is finished, you should be able to view the site at
[localhost:8070](http://localhost:8070).

You can create a full fledge demo to test your site by running:

```bash
make demo-site
```

Note that the README of your newly created site factory contains detailed
information about how to configure and run a site.

Once you're happy with your site, don't forget to backup your work e.g. by
committing it and pushing it to a new git repository.

## Theming

Probably you want to change the default theme. The cookiecutter adds an extra scss frontend folder with a couple of templates where you can use to change the default styling of the site.
* `sites/<site>/src/frontend/scss/extras/colors/_palette.scss`
* `sites/<site>/src/frontend/scss/extras/colors/_theme.scss`

To change the default logo of the site, you need to create the folder `sites/<site>/src/backend/base/static/richie/images` and then override the new `logo.png` picture.

## Update your Richie site factory

If we later improve our scripts, you will be able to update your own site
factory by replaying Cookiecutter. This will override your files in the
project's scaffolding but, don't worry, it will respect all the sites you
will have created in the `sites` directory:

```
cookiecutter --overwrite-if-exists gh:openfun/richie --directory=cookiecutter
```

## Help us improve this project

After starting your project, please submit an issue let us know how it went and
what other features we should add to make it better.
