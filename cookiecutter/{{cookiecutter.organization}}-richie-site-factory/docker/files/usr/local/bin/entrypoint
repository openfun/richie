# The container user (see USER in the Dockerfile) is an un-privileged user that
# does not exists and is not created during the build phase (see Dockerfile).
# Hence, we use this entrypoint to wrap commands that will be run in the
# container to create an entry for this user in the /etc/passwd file.
#
# The following environment variables may be passed to the container to
# customize running user account:
#
#   * USER_NAME: container user name (default: default)
#   * HOME     : container user home directory (default: none)
#
# To pass environment variables, you can either use the -e option of the docker
# run command:
#
#     docker run --rm -e USER_NAME=foo -e HOME='/home/foo' foo:latest python manage.py migrate
#
# or define new variables in an environment file to use with docker or
# docker-compose:
#
#     # env.d/development
#     USER_NAME=foo
#     HOME=/home/foo
#
#     docker run --rm --env-file env.d/development foo:latest python manage.py migrate
