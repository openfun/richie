# Upgrade

All instructions to upgrade this project from one release to the next will be
documented in this file. Upgrades must be run sequentially, meaning you should
not skip minor/major releases while upgrading (fix releases can be skipped).

The format is inspired from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Before any upgrade, collect static files and run database migrations:

```bash
$ make collectstatic
$ make migrate
```
