# Our frontend expects BCP47/RFC5646 locales (eg. fr-FR). Django, on the other hand,
# supports ISO639-1 language codes without a region (e.g. fr) which is sufficient
# if you don't need to differentiate several regional versions of the same language.
#
# BCP47/RFC5646 lets us specify language-region pairs by combining ISO639-1 language codes and
# ISO3166-1 region codes using a dash (eg. fr-FR).
#
# The only thing we're missing for this to be bridged completely is to make sure locales
# set on the <html> element are also available in our React frontend.
#
# This is where this setting comes in: it lists available locales by order of priority:
# the first matching locale will be used if your LANGUAGES setting declares languages without
# regions.
