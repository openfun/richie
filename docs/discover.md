If you're just looking for a quick preview of `Richie`, you can take a look and have a tour of `Richie` on our dedicated [demo site](https://demo.richie.education).

Login/password are `admin`/`admin`. The database is regularly flushed.


### Start your own site

The next step after discovering Richie on the demo is to start your own project. We provide a
production-ready template based on [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) that
allows you to generate your project in seconds.

Follow the guide on [starting your own Richie project with Cookiecutter](./cookiecutter.md).

Once you created a new site, you will be able to fully customize it:

- override any Django template or portion of template,
- [override ReactJS components](./frontend-overrides.md),
- override some css rules or rebuild the whole css with your own variables and customizations,
- add any [DjangoCMS](https://www.django-cms.org) plugin or feature,
- add any [Django third-party application](https://djangopackages.org).
